Why I choose this portfolio?

I have decided to do a portfolio site as it utilizes the effort to something practical which I can develop further. 
It also enhances the way presenting myself professionally. It is simplified portfolio version as it aims to refer to my current level programming abilities. 
The page targets recruiter and employers, hence it keeps things short. Such users don't spend much time in reading long text as it usually takes up to couple of minutes to glance over the portfolio. 
At the botton  contains social links for additional references and keep the content light.

It includes active navbar consistent on mobille and desktop and hints the active language as the page contains also a version in Bulgarian which is mine native language. Makes the page accessible for users who prefer to see it in Bulgarian, especially in the skills section.

This feature makes the landing page more intuitive.
