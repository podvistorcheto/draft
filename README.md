### Why this portfolio page?

The project aims to implement the mobile-first approach to achieve a more user-friendly and intuitive version of the page content. I have decided to do a portfolio site as it utilizes the effort to do something practical which I can develop further. 

It also enhances the way of presenting myself professionally. Having a simplified portfolio version also tries to refer to my career path and current programming abilities. 

The page targets recruiters and employers. Hence it keeps things short and simple. Usually, such user groups don't spend much time in reading the long text as it takes up to a couple of minutes to glance over the portfolio. The site provides more than one point of use to download or print CV for users with a traditional approach. The page footer contains social links for additional reference and renders completeness.

### Features

#### Existing Features

##### Landing page

It includes active navbar consistent on mobile and desktop and a active language bar. There is a version in Bulgarian which is my native language. Makes the page more accessible for users who prefer to see it in Bulgarian, especially for the skills section.
Navbar menu provides also the option to switch languages as in case the user missed the option to spot the active language link at the top right of the screen. This way, once the user is checking the navbar, won’t need to look for a language change elsewhere.  This feature makes the landing page more intuitive. 

##### About Me</h5>

This section has the skills and a brief text motto about me and presents the current skillset altogether as it saves time for users. 

##### Contact Form

To make it more responsive for the user it prompts a ‘not valid form’ message if even the first required field is not filled. Once the input is provided the pop-up message informs the user for the purpose of the website. To avoid a dark pattern it advises the user to follow the LinkedIn icon provided in the pop-up.

##### Footer

Provides links to social media accounts. Includes a separate column for the user to download and find a printable version of my CV.

#### New Features

The page suggest some features to be implemented in the future. A personal blog with my hobby as I write football articles as freelance journalist. The section with my programming abilities can bear updates once I deveolop more IT projects.

### Technologies

- HTML5
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- Inline JavaScript - used in the index.html to make the contact form responsive. Probably not the most elegant approach but javascript is yet to be covered in the next module of the course. Hence, I adopted this approach with adding the inline script. Tutors advised me to use solution from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45914792/validate-form-before-bootstrap-modal-popup). It was later modified (see acknowledgents).



### Testing

The page was tested on different browsers beside Chrome (Firefox, Safari and Edge). Thanks to bootstrap css features it achieved relative consistency in the content whether the user chooses desktop or mobile. 
One can spot a difference in the footer layout. The desktop version gives all three columns with full details and title text When a user switches to mobile, the columns are reduced to two, as the first one (about me) becomes redundant due to the limited space. 
Title of the social links also becomes redundant and it is removed to make the mobile layout a bit easier to navigate.

A minor detail that is adjusted for the mobile - added a media query to reduce letter spacing on mobile to make the 'ABOUT ME' appear on one row and still keep the design consistency to some extent.
